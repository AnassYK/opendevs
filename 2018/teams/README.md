# How to fill your team in here

Each team has to put a directory inside here. Please, create a directory with your team's name. We expect that inside your directory you put the following structure:

 - reports/
   - member1/
     - year/month/day.txt
     - ...
   - member2/
     - ...
   - presentationLanguage.pdf
   - presentationReverseEngineering.pdf
   - ...
   
Feel free to put any documentation relative to your team, anything that could help you understand or us to understand your advance in the course.

To modify this, we expect your pull request!
