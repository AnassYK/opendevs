Used ProfStef to learn the basic syntax of the language.
Went on the site mooc.pharo.org and looked up the courses on the language.
Done the exercises of the same site to push the knowledge we had of the language, up to the exercice about the dice (included).
Watched the videos of the same site to get a better idea of what really is OOP.
